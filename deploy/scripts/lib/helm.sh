# helm_upgrade, the one way the install scripts change a Helm release (deploy/scripts/lib/common.sh
# sources this file; it needs STATE_DIR, the environment's local state).
#
# helm_upgrade <release> <chart> <helm upgrade arguments, --namespace among them>...
#   runs `helm upgrade --install <release> <chart> <arguments>`, holding the release's lock in this
#   workspace's local state (helm-<namespace>-<release>.lock) the whole time: a second run of this
#   workspace waits for the first (HELM_LOCK_WAIT seconds at most, default 3600), and the helm it
#   starts holds the lock too, so the lock is free only once that helm is gone. The lock is the
#   workspace's: two workspaces (worktrees) driving one environment are not serialized by it; one
#   environment is installed from one workspace at a time.
#
#   Before each change it makes (a recovery's rollback, then the upgrade), it records in <lock>.run
#   the revision that change is about to create, as running, and marks the record finished once that
#   helm has returned by itself (whatever its exit status: Helm then recorded the outcome). A helm
#   killed by a signal, or a run killed while its helm ran (a lost SSH session, a Ctrl-C, a host
#   restart), leaves the record running; found so when the lock is free again, the revision it names
#   is that killed run's.
#
#   A release found in pending-install, pending-upgrade or pending-rollback (Helm then refuses every
#   later operation with "another operation (install/upgrade/rollback) is in progress") is recovered
#   only when its pending revision is the one this workspace's killed run recorded: a pending-upgrade
#   or pending-rollback is rolled back to the last deployed revision, a pending-install that never
#   deployed is uninstalled, so that the upgrade can install it again. Any other pending revision (a
#   helm of another workspace, or one run by hand, perhaps still running) is left alone, and the call
#   fails saying how to recover it by hand. Each recovery is logged on stderr.

# helm_pending_action <status> <history-json> <record>: what to do about the release, one line of
# three tab-separated fields, the action (upgrade, rollback, uninstall or refuse), the revision to
# roll back to (- for the others) and why. <record> is the previous run's "<state> <revision> <pid>
# <host>", or empty.
