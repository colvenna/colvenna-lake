"""The project's old name is gone (#271, #286): the product was Cove Lake, and every technical identifier
began with cove (cove-lake, CoveLake, COVE_, com.covelake ...) until 2026-10-25. This check fails on
the old name anywhere in the repository but where exceptions.tsv allows it: the naming history, the
records of the candidates made before the rename, and this check's own definitions.

What it looks for, case not mattering:

- "cove" as a word or the start of one, in a file's text or its path: cove-lake, CoveLake, covelake,
  COVE_ENV, and inside an identifier where a capital starts it (isCoveTable, CoveTaskFailed,
  coveResnapshot). Not inside a word (recover, discover), nor in the English words that start with it,
  their letters in the same case (cover, Covenant, COVERAGE, covet, covey). Only ASCII letters are
  letters here, so Chinese text right before it does not hide it.
- A hexadecimal literal (0x and 8 to 16 digits) whose bytes, either way round, spell it: a key such
  as 0x636f76656361744c ("covecatL") hides the name from a text search.

exceptions.tsv: one exception a line, <path glob> TAB <text> TAB <reason>. A hit is allowed in a file
the glob matches, on a line holding the text ("*": any line). Lines starting with "#" are comments.

Usage: old_name.py FILE...   (pre-commit passes the staged files)
       old_name.py --all     (every file git tracks)
